emailsnap
=========

A script to take a snap from an internal webcam using the ThinkVantage button on a Thinkpad or other hardware button for other laptops (has been tested on an Asus as well) and email it somewhere.

Dependencies:

* VLC
* Thunderbird/Icedove
* xbindkeys 
* ImageMagick (though you may not need it).

You will have to edit both files to include the absolute path to the script and any individual image tweaks your webcam snap may need via Imagemagick.

.xbindkeys goes in your home folder.
