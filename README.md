emailsnap
=========

A script to take a snap from an internal webcam using the ThinkVantage button on a Thinkpad or other hardware button for other laptops (has been tested on an Asus as well) and email it somewhere.

Dependencies require VLC, Thunderbird/Icedove, xbindkeys and ImageMagick (though you may not need it).

You will have to edit both files to fill in your username/path to the script and any individual image tweaks your webcam snap may need via Imagemagick.

.xbindkeys goes in your home folder.
