emailsnap
=========

A script to take a snap from a Thinkpad webcam using the ThinkVantage button and email it somewhere.

Dependencies require VLC, Thunderbird/Icedove, xbindkeys and ImageMagick (though you may not need it).

You will have to edit both files to fill in your username/path to the script and any individual image tweaks your webcam snap may need via Imagemagick.
